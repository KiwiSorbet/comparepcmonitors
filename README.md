This is a [modified](https://kiwisorbet.github.io] version of [comparepcmonitors.com](https://comparepcmonitors.com/) that is meant to make the website faster. Rather than storing all of the monitor data directly inside of the table rows of the HTML served to the client, we scrape that data into a JSON file that is then used to render the monitor table dynamically. In addition, we add pagination to reduce the amount of lag from having to render thousands of of table rows.

Overall, this makes the page load much faster and also makes sorting and filtering much more snappy on low-end devices having a much more minimal footprint since not all tables rows are loaded in the DOM at all times.
